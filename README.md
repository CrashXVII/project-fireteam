### Project Fireteam

A learning project utilizing the Bungie.net API to help me and my fireteam easily coordinate weekly milestones and powerful engram activities.

## Goals
Get practice writing in React.js and using API calls.

Create an app/site that a fireteam can log in, and get an interactive list of the current weekly milestones everyone in the group has in common.
