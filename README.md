### Project Fireteam

A learning project utilizing the Bungie.net API to help me and my fireteam easily coordinate weekly milestones and powerful engram activities.

## Goals and Features
Create an app/site that a fireteam can log in, and get an interactive list of the current weekly milestones everyone in the group has in common.

Ability to sort Milestones.

Track progress on Milestones, and who has them completed.

Gain experience writing React.js, using API calls and working with styled-components.
